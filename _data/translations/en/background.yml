  description: "<p>Our interdisciplinary team of geoinformaticians, pedagogues, communication scientists and economists has many years of practical experience in the conception and implementation of workshops and advanced training with teachers and students. It turned out that working with microcontrollers under the ideas of Physical Computing and Internet of Things offers a particularly accessible way into the world of programming and Computational Thinking. The collection of environmental data such as temperature, humidity and fine dust pollution with self-built sensor stations offers a unique reference to reality and an almost unsurpassable topicality. Based on these experiences, the senseBox:edu was developed 7 years ago as an experiment set for use in schools or other educational institutions, the senseBox:mini as an introductory set for home use and the senseBox:home as a Citizen Science Toolkit. <br><br> In 2018, <a href=\"https://www.reedu.de\" class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\">Reedu GmbH & Co. KG</a> was founded as a spin-off of the Institute for Geionformatics and the senseBox project. Today, the Reedu team is responsible for the further development of software and hardware, the distribution of the sets and the development of educational offers around the senseBox in close cooperation with the university. This connection is particularly led by a joint research project Open Photonik Pro of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.</p>"
