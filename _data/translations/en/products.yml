introduction: "<p>There are two variations of senseBox; <em>senseBox:home</em> and <em>senseBox:edu</em>.</p>

    <p><em>senseBox:home</em> contains less devices, therefore it is easier to build manually and set up in your home,  in order to measure unique environmental phenomena. It can also be connected to your WiFi or LAN port. The user obtains the individual source code after their registration to <em>openSenseMap</em>. Following registration, users can view continuous, location based measurements collected from sensors, such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, brightness, UV-light and noise on the openSenseMap.</p>

    <p>The <em>senseBox:edu</em> was specifically developed to be applied in school classrooms or by junior scientists at home. The project focus is on learning the basics of programming and electronics, and is related to the collection of environmental data.</p>

edu:
  description: "<p>senseBox:edu offers schools, starting from the 7th grade, the possibility to learn programming in a fun and playful environment, to be a real citizen scientist and to get to know the world of geoinformatics.
In the upper grades it can be used for projects on environmental phenomena, where sensor stations are built, programmed and positioned by the students.
Furthermore the sensor stations are connected to the Internet, where the measurements are updated and published on <a href=\"http://www.sensebox.de/en/osem\" class=\"link\">openSenseMap</a>. In this way, data can be shared with other schools, citizens and scientists.</p>
    <p><b>Features</b></p>
